## About <a name = "about"></a>
Eutuxia provisions the cloud infrastructure for bootstraping a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. She only provisions the compute resources â€”VMs, Load Balancer, Disks etc. and not a functioning kubernetes cluster.
The components, networking routes, certificate authority etc., that does scheduling and pod maintainance will need to be installed separately.


## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
After cloning the repo, to run Terraform locally, you first authenticate using the command line (for dev and testing), then configure the Azure provider.
